web site for PDP
a site from the online course an address for the online course: https://www.udemy.com/course/the-modern-flexbox-grid-sass-animations-developer-course/ 
Please note the author of the course uses some horrible practices like selection by ID in CSS, using let instead of const a way to long html and css files etc. 
I've tried to fix it where possible, or just leave a comment that some not reasonable selection was done due studying purposes.

I've also ommited minification of the .css files by intention in order to make the review via borwsers a bit simplier.
